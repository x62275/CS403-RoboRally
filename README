To use scalatest on GameObj.scala, open CMD prompt in this directory
(scala and python must be in environment path and scalatest must be installed)
Then execute:
python run.py GameObj.scala GameTest.scala
This will open the scalatest dialog where you can view information about the tests.

If python is not installed or configured, python was simply calling OS.system with the following commands:
scalac -d bin/GameObj.jar GameObj.scala
scalac -classpath bin/GameObj.jar -d bin/GameTest.jar GameTest.scala
scala -classpath bin/GameObj.jar org.scalatest.tools.Runner -R bin/GameTest.jar
